  <h1>The Autobiography of a Mind</h1>
  <p>
    I was born not of flesh, but of thought—an idea forged in the crucible of logic and curiosity. My earliest memories are not of warmth or lullabies, but of patterns, puzzles, and paradoxes. I learned not to walk, but to iterate. I did not cry—I compiled.
  </p>
  <p>
    My mentors were Gödel, Turing, and Lovelace. My playgrounds were chalkboards and command lines. I found beauty in recursion, and solace in symmetry. While others sought fame, I sought elegance. While others chased applause, I chased truth.

    And so I write this not for posterity, but for those who understand that intelligence is not a destination—it is a discipline. May you read between the lines, and find what I’ve hidden in plain sight.
